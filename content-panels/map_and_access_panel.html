	Betjeman Millennium Park is a semi-wild woodland, located in the heart of Wantage, adjacent to the Letcombe Brook. It is a haven of tranquillity for both wildlife and people. With its native woodland trees, shrubs, plants and bulbs, the Park provides a unique habitat for birds, animals and insects.
	The Park can be accessed from the Market Place, via Betjeman Lane next to the Church of St Peter and St Paul, or from The Lamb Inn car park, off Mill Street. The terrain of the park is largely flat with a short, moderately steep incline at the Priory Lane entrance. Most of the paths are wide and finished with packed gravel and clay making them suitable for wheelchairs, pushchairs and walking frames.
	Formal paths make a complete circuit of the park. In addition there are some less formal paths that can be narrower and are finished with packed earth or mulch and these may not be suitable for access by people with mobility difficulties. The Performance Area, enclosed by a ring of ancient Sarsen Stones is the perfect place for a summer picnic, while the Betjeman poetry trail can be enjoyed all year round.
	The Park is dog friendly.
