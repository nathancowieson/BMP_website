	The terrain of the park is largely flat with a short, moderately steep incline at the Priory Lane entrance. Most of the paths are wide and finished with packed gravel and clay making them suitable for wheelchairs, pushchairs and walking frames. These formal paths make a complete circuit of the park. In addition there are some less formal paths that can be narrower and are finished with packed earth or mulch and these may not be suitable for access by people with mobility difficulties.
