	  In 1997 a plot of derelict land was purchased by what is now the Betjeman Millenium Park Trust with planning permission to create a park. The design and layout of the new park was led be a vision to create a semi-natural area consisting of woodland glades linked by a net-work of informal paths. It was envisaged that the Park would:
	</p>
	<ul class="fs-4">
	  <li>provide a haven for wildlife species, whose populations and diversity would be encouraged to increase</li>
	  <li>be a place of peace and tranquillity for local residents and visitors to enjoy in a variety of ways</li>
	  <li>a space to display excerpts from the work of John Betjeman and encourage visitors to engage with creativity and the Arts</li>
	</ul>

	In 1999-2000, with thanks to grants from the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and Southern Arts, a series of six "Stone Poetry Plaque" sculptures were installed in the park by the artist <a href='https://alecpeever.com/'>Alex Peever</a>. The park was officially opened in 2002 and is celebrating its 20th anniversary in May 2022.
