	The hard work of maintaining and developing our Park is carried out by a diverse and friendly group of volunteers. If you'd like to get involved please come along to one of our Working Parties. These usually take place on the <u>first Sunday of the month at 10 am</u>. We meet up in the Performance Area of the park. Check our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetjemanMillenniumPark/">Facebook page</a> for more up-to-date information. <u>We usually work for two hours</u> and stop for a tea break at 11.00. If you'd like to <a href="mailto:trustees@betjemanpark.org.uk">let us know</a> that you're coming then we can look out for you but otherwise just turn up in old clothes. Take a mug, gardening gloves and any convenient gardening tools if you have them though there are usually some going spare if you don't. We'll see you there!
