	The hard work of maintaining and developing our park is carried out by a diverse and friendly volunteers. If you feel you'd like to get involved the easiest way would be to come along to one of our Working Bee events. These generally take place on the first Sunday of the month meeting. We meet up in the Performance Area of the park around 10 am. Check our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetjemanMillenniumPark/">Facebook page</a> for more up-to-date information. We usually work for two hours and stop for a tea break in the middle. If you'd like to <a href="mailto:trustees@betjemanpark.org.uk">let us know</a> that you're coming then we can look out for you but otherwise just turn up in old clothes. Take a mug, gardening gloves and any convenient gardening tools if you have them though there are usually some going spare if you don't. We'll see you there!
